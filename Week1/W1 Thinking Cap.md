<li> <a href="https://impossiblefoods.com/locations/">Link to impossible food's location web map</a> </li>

<h2> Site's Agenda </h2>
This site was made to help consumers find the closest location to get impossible food's products.

<h3> Why I Chose This Site </h3>
I chose this website because it is a convenient way for people to obtain certain products and is a web map "use" that everyone is familiar with. During this pandemic, it is essential that people get quick and easy access to necessities such as food so that they don't have to leave the house for very long. As noted on the map, it is also a good way for people to also support local groceries/restaurants during the pandemic.

<h4> Map's Usage </h4>
<li> This map uses the user's location (or you can click on the states within the map) and pins would pop up for places with impossible food products. Even though I am not in the US, I am still able to use this map by clicking on the states or manually entering a location so, I think this web map works as intended.
<li> This map uses mapbox! </li>

<h5> What I Would Change </h5>
<li> If I could change something, it'll be to make it more visually appealing but I think even without it, it works well to serve it's intended purpose.
