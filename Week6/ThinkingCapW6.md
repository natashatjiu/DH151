<h3> What are your thoughts on "thick mapping in the digital humanities," and how does it differ from "mapping?" </h3> 

I've always believed Digital Humanities was about the stories behind data sets and numbers. I guess the comparison I'd make here is that "mapping" is like the "data set", the surface 
level and what we see at first glance, while "thick mapping in the digital humanities" would be the "stories" behind it and the explanation for why things are like that. When including
geographical ties to a particular number, it provides you with more than just the language they speak or which part of the world something happened in. It provides historical and 
cultural context. Similar to the project my group is working on now, there is a lot more behind something like "low income countries are the reason we have high air pollution". There is 
a famous saying that history is told by the victors, and thick mapping in digital humanities, I believe, plays a part in unravelling that part. It amplifies what goes behind what we 
are made to believe and forces us to delve deeper into understanding and making informed judgements about the things we know about the world. While the situation is not always black and white (meaning
what we learn might not always be what we believed was the right thing to do), there is a lot to learn about the way we interact with each other as individuals.

<h3> How does the theory of "thick mapping" inform narratives that are influencing your life? </h3> 

"Thick mapping" is a reminder at the back of my head that not everything we receive or learn about is ever "complete". In a literal sense, it helps me look further into information I receive
through sites such as webmaps and data sets. People are constantly changing so it would be ignorant to believe the data sets that depend on how they interact will remain stagnant. 
Similarly, it's easy to judge situations as we see it and to forget that behind it are individuals like us. Sometimes, the marginalized are the people we CHOOSE not to see and in many cases,
that could be the most harmful decision to make.
